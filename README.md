# Implementation Prompts due with Milestone 2:

1. **SPLITTING**
*How many units wide or tall did you consider a
rectangle too small to split?*

*FIXME*

2. **NUMBER CALLS**
*While filling out the above rectangle in the Mondrian style
using the series of steps above,
is there anything you noticed that will change how many times the
recursive function gets called? Explain*

*FIXME*

3. **EXTRA STEPS**
*Most design choices have advantages as well as disadvantages.
Given the above series of steps, are there any steps you 
felt were unnecessary given what other steps perform?*

*FIXME*

4. **DISADVANTAGE**
*Describe and explain at least one disadvantage of using recursion to
generate Mondrian art.*

5. **CHALLENGES IN BASIC ALGORITHM**
*What challengeS did you encounter in trying to achieve the 
basic algorithm? Explain.*

# Customization Prompts due with Final Milestone:

*FIXME*

6. **REQUIRED CUSTOMIZATIONS**
*What customizations did you make Mondrian art, and why did you choose it.*

*FIXME*

7. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process,
including how much your initial design plan evolved,
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results.
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*FIXME*

8. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the
lab easier for you.*

*FIXME*

9. **BIG O ANALYSIS**
*Please analyze the Big O of all of the methods of the MondrianArt class,
including constructors.
Hint: Given the random nature of this lab,
be sure you write about the worst case.*

*FIXME*

10. **TESTING**
*Please briefly describe your testing process.
Here you should be careful to select representative input cases,
including both representative typical cases as well as extreme cases.*

*FIXME*

11. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *FIXME*
- *FIXME*

12. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*FIXME*

13. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*INTEGRITY STATEMENT: Please briefly describe ALL help you 
received and all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references. 
If you worked in a pair you must also attested to only 
having worked together as a pair, not separately.*

14. **Pairwork statement**
If you worked in a pair of programmers, you are required 
to use good pair programming practices, always working 
together and not using a divide and conquer technique 
in which only one of you does the work and learns. 
Also, the two programmers roles should be switched 
frequently--around every 20 minutes or so. 
If you worked alone, please say so. If you worked in a pair, 
please describe how you worked together.
